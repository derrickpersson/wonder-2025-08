This is the root directory for the Wonder project.

We've included reference code that we can use to help build out our project.
The reference code is included in the `zed-main.zip` and the `gpui.zip` files.

The `gpui.zip` is the framework which we will be using to implement our project.

The `zed-main.zip` is an IDE that is an example project written in GPUI.
